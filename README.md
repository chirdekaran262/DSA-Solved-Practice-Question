# Solved DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Questions in Java

Welcome to the **DSA Solved Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems solved in **Java**. It is aimed at anyone looking to practice and improve their DSA skills using Java.

## What's Inside?

This repository covers a range of DSA topics, with fully implemented Java solutions for each problem. The solutions are those I have personally solved as part of my practice, and each one is designed to help you strengthen your understanding of important DSA concepts.

### Topics Covered:
- **Arrays and Strings**: Manipulation, searching, sorting
- **Linked Lists**: Operations, traversal, and algorithms
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation and problem-solving
- **Trees**: Traversal techniques, etc.
- **Hashing**: HashMaps, HashSets
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizing recursive solutions**(Upcoming)**
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Prime numbers, GCD, LCM, and more
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Solving optimization problems
